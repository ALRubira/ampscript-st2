AMPScript
====

It is an exact target creation, you can find the docs here: http://wiki.memberlandingpages.com/010_ExactTarget/020_Content/AMPscript/AMPscript_Syntax_Guide

I have some of the syntax hilighting working (code blocks, inline code, "constants"...).

TODO
====
*  Syntax hilighting in quotes in html attributes
*  Other language constructs (ie: for loops)
*  Figure out how to get it into the package control system
*  Turn AMPScript (HTML).tmLanguage into a .JSON-tmLanguage file for consistency
